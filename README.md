# IOTA Integration Gateway
I believe it is a vital to integrate IOTA protocol with business-related workflows that are available and used everyday.

Integration platforms such as ifttt.com or O365 (ex. MS Flow) are used in many business-related use cases everyday and triggers/actions based on IOTA protocol would be very good addition to them. Needless to say, it will enable wide range of additional use cases based on thousands of  third-party components that are solid part of the integration platforms today. It may also serve as a gateway to business analytics tools such as Power BI, Power Query, etc.

**The project roadmap:**
* Project infrastructure  - smart caching, controllers, etc.  - currently under the development
* Working interface to IFTTT platform - currently under the development
* Interface to MS Flow platform - planned
* Interface to some additional components from Office365 ecosystem such as Power BI, Power Query, etc. - to be considered
* Interface to some other business-related apps and platforms - to be considered
